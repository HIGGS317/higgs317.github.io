abstract: The matter that exists at the core of a neutron star is ambiguous. In this study, we try to find whether present astrophysical results can differentiate between different classes of equation of state. It was found that the mass–radius data and the f-mode oscillation frequency of the universal relation are not effective enough to differentiate them. We also studied whether kilonova signals differ for different types of post-merger remnants of binary neutron star mergers. It was found that the kilonova signal for prompt collapse differs significantly from that of the delayed collapse and the stable remnant.
