abstract:The matter that exists at the core of a neutron star is ambiguous. In this study, we try to find whether present astrophysical results can differentiate between different classes of equation of state. It was found that the massâ€“radius data and the f-mode oscillation frequency of the universal relation are not effective enough to differentiate them. We also studied whether kilonova signals differ for different types of post-merger remnants of binary neutron star mergers. It was found that the kilonova signal for prompt collapse differs significantly from that of the delayed collapse and the stable remnant.
