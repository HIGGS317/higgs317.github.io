#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hello, I am Divyansh Tripathi, Master's Student at IISER Bhopal. Currently majoring in Physics and interested in Astrophysics, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
I am interested in the study of Compact Object formation, evolution and accretion physics. I am also interested in MHD and Code Developments for solving astrophysical problems.
Some part of also wanders in the realm of ML-DL and there I am interested in techniques of the domain that can be useful for astrophysics.

Currently searching for graduate positions.
Please reach out at ~ divyansh20[at]iiserb[dot]ac[dot]in~ if you have any research positions, or you feel I can contribute to your projects.
