      text:
        I am a Final Year BS-MS Student at IISER Bhopal. I am interested in studying the High Energy Astrophsics, last stages of stellar evolutions and   Compact Objects such as Neutron Stars and Black Holes, their formation history and
        how they evolve. In particular binary systems like LMXBs and HMXBs are special interest to me as their complex history of accretion and evolution and formation of binary compact object which can serve as progenitor for the
        future gravitational wave events.
        I am also intrested in learning and designing MHD simulations and currently learning Pluto MHD Code. I am interested in investigating Astrophysical Jets,
        Accretion phenomenon, tidal disruption events through MHD simulations also learning how we can imporove them to include microphysics to imporove their accuracy.
        Apart from Astrophsics I am also interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques and how new emerging ideas in the fields like CNNs, and Diffusion Models can be used in Data-Driven Astronomy in conjunction with incoming
        telescopes and Survey like SKA,LSST and Euclid.
