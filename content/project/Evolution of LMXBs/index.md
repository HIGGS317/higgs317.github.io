In this project, I have studied about millisecond pulsars, their formation history and evolution. I studied about binary systems of Pulsars and main-sequence stars and how this system evolve. I studied these systems by permorfing simulations using stellar simulation code
<a href = "https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r24.03.1/" > MESA </a>.
Our aim for the project is to study the transient and persistent accretion in NS-Light Mass X-ray Binary system as these accretion characterstics is essential in understanding the spin evoution of NS stars, which can be then used to determine various kinds of physics. In this work we have shown using numerical computation and grid parameters of LMXBs how NS can be observed as a transient as well as persistent source over the course of LXMB phase and how it fits the observed distribution of known transient and persistent accretors.
