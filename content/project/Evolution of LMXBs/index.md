In this project, I have studied about millisecond pulsars, their formation history and evolution. I studied about binary systems of Pulsars and main-sequence stars and how this system evolve. I studied these systems by permorfing simulations using stellar simulation code
<a href = "https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r24.03.1/" > MESA </a>.
Our aim for the project is to study the transient and persistent accretion in X-ray binary phase of such systems and calculate the critical accretion rateon the accretor in the LXMBs using MESA and studying the various accretion states and how throughout the accretion phase pulsar goes from transient to persistent phase and if these could explain the parameters of observed LMXBs systems.
