This project was done as part of Summer Student Program at NCTS-TCA, Taiwan under the supervision of Dr.Hsien Shang and Dr.Somdeb Bhattacharya. In this project, I have used a HD-MHD code pluto to get hands on experience of public numerical codes used in astrophysics. I explored the numerical Hydrodynaimcs module in pluto and how higher order schemes can be used, how well they can approximate known solution.I explored Conservative Finite Difference schemes like WENO3,WENOZ and MP5 which are class of third order and fifth order accurate schemes and use them on various test
problems like Sod Shock Tube, Shu-Oscher Shock Tube, Double Mach Reflection and the Rayliegh-Taylor Instability.

Some of the animations and experiments are shown below:
