This project was done as part of Summer Student Program at NCTS-TCA, Taiwan under the supervision of Dr.Hsien Shang and Dr.Somdeb Bhattacharya.
In this project, I have used a MHD code pluto to get hands on experience of public numerical codes used in astrophysics. I explored the numerical Hydrodynaimcs
module in pluto and how higher order schemes can be used, how well they can approximate known solution.
I explored schemes like WENO3,WENOZ and MP5 which are class of third order and fifth order accurate schemes.
